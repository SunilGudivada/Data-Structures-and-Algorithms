# About a bunch of links

Below I will give many links to books and materials that I find interesting and useful. But this does not mean that you need to read all the materials - so you have no time for preparation is not enough ðŸ˜€

Therefore, focus on your goals and priorities, your starting level, and the number the time you have. You probably don't need to read 10 books on algorithms. Instead of this try the ones that work best for you. Stop at the one that you will work best. Choose the second "spare" if you don't really like how some the topic is explained in your "master" book.

Everyone has different ways of learning and perceiving information, and if some book is the most the best, this does not mean that it will be the same for you. So I won't give advice in the key "Be sure to read this particular book." Take some time to select resources just for yourself.

And yet, I give links to books on Amazon, but many of them are available on the Internet or on youtube at audio format for free. I don't want to give download links as books are often deleted and the link will become a bat, and I have no time to track and edit them. But you will easily find most of the books are via Google or, as a last resort, torrents.
