# Maintainability

## Operability

Makes it easier for the operations team to keep the system running smoothly.

## Simplicity

Make it easier for engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible from the system.

## Evolvability

Make it easy for engineers to make the changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as extensibility, modifiability, plasticity.
