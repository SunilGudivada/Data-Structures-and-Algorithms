Welcome to my public notebook, a dynamic and evolving repository of knowledge! Here, I document my daily learnings and insights across a range of topics integral to the world of software engineering and computer science. This notebook is meticulously updated on a day-to-day basis, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

Within these pages, you'll find detailed sections dedicated to Data Structures, Algorithms, System Design, and Interview Questions. Each section is crafted to provide clear, concise, and practical information that can aid in both academic study and professional preparation.

#### Data Structures

Explore various data structures, their implementations, and applications. From arrays and linked lists to trees and graphs, this section covers the fundamentals and beyond, providing both theoretical and practical perspectives.

#### Algorithms

Dive into the world of algorithms, where I break down complex problems and solutions. This section includes a variety of algorithmic strategies such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more, with detailed explanations and examples.

#### System Design

Understand the principles and practices of designing scalable and efficient systems. This section delves into the architecture of well-known applications and services, offering insights into their inner workings and design considerations.

#### Interview Questions

Prepare for technical interviews with a curated list of questions and answers. This section covers a wide array of topics, providing sample problems, detailed solutions, and tips for effective problem-solving during interviews.

I hope this notebook serves as a valuable resource in your journey to mastering these critical topics. Whether you are a student, a professional, or an enthusiast, there's something here for everyone. Happy learning!
