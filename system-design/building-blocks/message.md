## Introduction

In the modern distributed systems, Asynchronous messaging options are broadly classified into the categories below.&#x20;

* Message queues
* Pub/sub systems
* Event streaming platforms
* Event routing and processing services
* Stream processing services
* Enterprise messaging systems&#x20;
* Managed messaging services

<details>

<summary>Producer can directly communicate with Consumer, but why do we need intermediate step message broker? </summary>

_/Response from ChatGPT_

* **Decoupling**:
  * **Independence**: Producers and consumers can operate independently without needing to know each otherâ€™s specifics. This decoupling allows for easier maintenance and updates since changes in one component do not necessitate changes in the other.
  * **Scalability**: Producers and consumers can be scaled independently based on their load requirements.

<!---->

* **Reliability**:
  * **Message Persistence**: Message brokers can persist messages to ensure they are not lost in case of a failure. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity in distributed systems.
  * **Retry Mechanisms**: Brokers can manage message retries, ensuring that messages are delivered even if the consumer temporarily goes down.

<!---->

* **Load Balancing**:
  * **Distributed Load**: Brokers can distribute the load among multiple consumers, preventing any single consumer from becoming a bottleneck.
  * **Backpressure Handling**: Brokers can manage backpressure by queuing messages when the consumer is overwhelmed, thus preventing system crashes due to overload.

<!---->

* **Flexibility**:
  * **Message Routing**: Brokers can route messages based on various criteria such as content, topic, or headers, allowing complex communication patterns like publish-subscribe, request-reply, and fan-out.
  * **Transformation**: Some brokers can transform messages, ensuring compatibility between different versions of producers and consumers.

<!---->

* **Resilience**:
  * **Fault Tolerance**: Brokers often come with built-in fault tolerance, allowing systems to continue operating smoothly even when some components fail.
  * **Failover**: In case a consumer fails, the broker can redirect messages to another available consumer.

<!---->

* **Monitoring and Management**:
  * **Metrics and Logging**: Message brokers provide detailed metrics and logging capabilities, allowing for better monitoring and debugging of the system.
  * **Throttling**: Brokers can throttle message delivery to consumers, preventing system overload.

<!---->

* **Security**:
  * **Access Control**: Brokers can enforce access control policies, ensuring that only authorized producers and consumers can communicate.
  * **Encryption**: Brokers can handle message encryption, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission.

</details>

Let's go through all the services categories.&#x20;

First let me clarify why there are distinct categories. We can classify messages into two.

* If the producer expects an action from the consumer, that message is a _command_.&#x20;
* If the message informs the consumer that an action has taken place, then the message is an _event_.

**Understand your requirement clearly and then go for which messaging system to use.**&#x20;

Now lets go through all the categories once and identify what all the different cloud providers are providing.

### Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Order Processing System**

* **Scenario**: An e-commerce platform processes customer orders.
* **Implementation**: When a customer places an order, it is placed in a message queue (e.g., Amazon SQS). A pool of worker applications (consumers) retrieves orders from the queue, processes payments, updates inventory, and generates shipping labels. This decoupling ensures that order submission is fast and reliable, and the processing workload is distributed.

**Use Case 2: Email Notification Service**

* **Scenario**: A web application sends email notifications for various user activities (e.g., sign-up, password reset).
* **Implementation**: User actions trigger messages to be sent to a queue (e.g., Azure Queue Storage). An email service retrieves messages from the queue and sends out the emails. This ensures that email sending does not block the userâ€™s primary action and provides resilience and scalability.
