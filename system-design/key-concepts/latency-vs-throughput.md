# 🌐 Latency Vs Throughput

### Latency

**Latency** is the time taken for a request to travel from the client to the server and back. It's a measure of the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. Latency is often measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs).

* **Low Latency**: Indicates that there is minimal delay in data transfer.
* **High Latency**: Indicates that there is a significant delay in data transfer.

**Factors Affecting Latency**:

* **Network Speed**: Slower networks increase latency.
* **Distance**: Longer physical distances between the client and server can increase latency.
* **Processing Time**: Time taken by the server to process a request.
* **Congestion**: High traffic on the network can increase latency.

### Throughput

**Throughput** is the amount of data that can be processed by a system within a given amount of time. It is often measured in bits per second (bps), requests per second (RPS), or transactions per second (TPS).

* **High Throughput**: Indicates that the system can handle a large number of requests or process a large amount of data in a short time.
* **Low Throughput**: Indicates that the system can handle only a few requests or process a small amount of data in the same time period.

**Factors Affecting Throughput**:

* **Bandwidth**: Higher bandwidth can increase throughput.
* **Concurrency**: The ability of the system to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
* **Resource Availability**: Availability of CPU, memory, and other resources.
* **Efficiency of Algorithms**: More efficient algorithms can process data faster.

#### Balancing Latency and Throughput

In system design, there's often a trade-off between latency and throughput:

* **Low Latency vs. High Throughput**: Systems designed for low latency often process fewer requests at a time to ensure quick response times, potentially reducing overall throughput.
* **High Throughput vs. Low Latency**: Systems designed for high throughput may process many requests simultaneously, which can introduce delays and increase latency.

#### Use Cases

* **Low Latency Systems**: Real-time applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and financial trading platforms where quick response times are crucial.
* **High Throughput Systems**: Batch processing systems, data analytics platforms, and high-traffic web servers where the ability to handle large volumes of data is more important than immediate response times.

#### Example

* **Video Streaming Service**:
  * **Low Latency**: Ensures that when a user clicks play, the video starts with minimal delay.
  * **High Throughput**: Ensures that the service can stream video to millions of users simultaneously.
