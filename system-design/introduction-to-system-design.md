# Introduction to system design

In common words, System design is nothing but creating the blue print for the Software, like how the civil engineer has the blue print for the Entire Building/ corporate society. This is very crucial for the development of the large scale applications,  especially those expected to handle high traffic, large amounts of data, and complex operations.

> It is often a key topic in technical interviews for software engineering roles, particularly for senior positions, as it demonstrates the candidate's ability to think critically about the structure and functioning of complex systems.

Below are the list of key concepts:&#x20;

1.  **Scalability:** Scalability in system design refers to the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. This can involve various dimensions, such as:

    * <mark style="color:purple;">**Horizontal Scalability**</mark>: Adding more machines or nodes to a system to distribute the load. For example, adding more servers to handle more web traffic.



    * <mark style="color:purple;">**Vertical Scalability**</mark>: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine to handle more load.
    * <mark style="color:purple;">**Performance Scalability**</mark>: Maintaining or improving performance levels as the system scales up. This means that the system can handle more requests per second, perform more transactions, or store more data without a decrease in performance.
    * <mark style="color:purple;">**Geographical Scalability**</mark>: Ensuring the system can operate efficiently across multiple geographic locations. This involves distributing data centers and ensuring low-latency access to users globally.
