# System design component checklist

System design is a critical aspect of building scalable and efficient software systems. Understanding the key components involved in system design can help in architecting robust and maintainable solutions. Here are the primary components:

1. **Client-Side Components**:
   * **Web Clients**: Browsers and web applications.
   * **Mobile Clients**: Android, iOS applications.\

2. **Server-Side Components**:
   * **Web Servers**: Serve static and dynamic content to clients.
   * **Application Servers**: Handle business logic and application services.
   * **Database Servers**: Store and manage data.\

3. **Databases**:
   * **Relational Databases (SQL)**: Structured data storage with relationships (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   * **NoSQL Databases**: Flexible schema for unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).\

4. **Cache**:
   * **In-Memory Cache**: Speed up data retrieval (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
   * **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute content to users globally with minimal latency.\

5. **Load Balancers**:
   * Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.\

6. **Message Queues**:
   * Enable asynchronous communication between services (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka).\

7. **API Gateways**:
   * Act as an entry point for clients to interact with backend services, handling request routing, rate limiting, and security (e.g., NGINX, Kong).\

8. **Microservices**:
   * Independently deployable services that communicate over APIs, allowing for modular and scalable system architecture.\

9. **Service Discovery**:
   * Automatically detect and manage microservices in a dynamic environment (e.g., Consul, Eureka).\

10. **Configuration Management**:
    * Centralized management of configuration settings for consistency and ease of updates (e.g., etcd, Consul).\

11. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    * **Monitoring**: Track system performance and health (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
    * **Logging**: Collect and analyze logs for debugging and auditing (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).\

12. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    * **Authentication**: Verify user identity (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
    * **Authorization**: Control user access to resources (e.g., RBAC, ABAC).\

13. **Scalability and Reliability**:
    * **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers to distribute the load.
    * **Vertical Scaling**: Add more resources to existing servers.
    * **Redundancy**: Duplicate critical components to avoid single points of failure.
    * **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures.\

14. **Networking**:
    * **DNS**: Resolve domain names to IP addresses.
    * **Firewalls and Security Groups**: Control access to network resources.\

15. **DevOps and CI/CD**:
    * **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate code integration, testing, and deployment (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).\

16. **Data Processing**:
    * **Batch Processing**: Process large volumes of data in batches (e.g., Hadoop).
    * **Stream Processing**: Process data in real-time as it flows through the system (e.g., Apache Flink, Apache Storm).\

17. **Analytics and Reporting**:
    * Generate insights and reports from collected data to drive decision-making (e.g., Google Analytics, Tableau).

By integrating these components effectively, you can design systems that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable, meeting the demands of modern applications and user expectations.
