# ⏱️ Step By Step Guide

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Start by asking questions to fully understand the requirements and scope of the problem. This shows your interviewer that you are thorough and detail-oriented.
  * Example: "Are we designing this system for a global audience or a specific region?"
* **Tips:**
  * **Don't Rush:** Take your time to understand the problem fully before diving into the solution.
  * **Focus on Requirements:** Ensure you know what the interviewer expects in terms of functionality and performance.
  * **Engage with the Interviewer:** Show your interest and thoughtfulness by asking relevant questions.

***

**Step 2: Define the Scope and Requirements**

* **Functional Requirements:** Identify the core functionalities the system must have.
  * Example: "The system should handle user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates."
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Determine performance, scalability, and reliability needs.
  * Example: "The system should support up to 1 million concurrent users with 99.99% uptime."
* **Tips:**
  * **Prioritize Requirements:** Focus on the most critical requirements first.
  * **Be Specific:** Clearly define both functional and non-functional requirements.
  * **Balance Needs:** Consider both user needs and technical constraints.

***

**Step 3: High-Level System Design**

* **Draw the Architecture:** Create a high-level diagram of the system architecture. Include key components like databases, servers, and external services.
  * Example: "We'll use a microservices architecture with load balancers, a distributed database, and a CDN for content delivery."
* **Explain Your Choices:** Justify the technologies and patterns you’ve chosen.
  * Example: "We’re using microservices for better scalability and maintainability."
* **Tips:**
  * **Keep It Simple:** Start with a simple design and add complexity as needed.
  * **Use Standard Symbols:** Make sure your diagrams are clear and easy to understand.
  * **Communicate Clearly:** Explain your thought process and choices to the interviewer.

***

**Step 4: Detailed Component Design**

* **Focus on Key Components:** Dive deeper into the design of crucial parts of the system.
  * Example: "For user authentication, we’ll implement OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens."
* **Data Models:** Define the data schema and storage mechanisms.
  * Example: "We'll use a relational database for transactional data and a NoSQL database for user sessions."
* **Tips:**
  * **Modular Approach:** Break down the system into smaller, manageable components.
  * **Consider Alternatives:** Discuss different design options and their trade-offs.
  * **Ensure Consistency:** Keep data models and design patterns consistent across components.

***

**Step 5: Scalability and Reliability**

* **Handling Traffic:** Discuss strategies for scaling the system.
  * Example: "We'll use auto-scaling groups and a global load balancer to handle traffic spikes."
* **Fault Tolerance:** Explain how the system will handle failures.
  * Example: "We’ll implement redundancy with multiple data centers and use a backup and restore strategy for data recovery."
* **Tips:**
  * **Plan for Growth:** Design the system to handle increasing loads over time.
  * **Redundancy is Key:** Implement redundancy to ensure high availability.
  * **Use Proven Solutions:** Apply industry best practices for scalability and reliability.

***

**Step 6: Envelope Calculations**

* **Estimate Load:** Calculate the expected load on the system based on the number of users and their interactions.
  * Example: "Assume 1 million daily active users, each making an average of 10 requests per day, resulting in 10 million requests daily."
* **Data Storage Requirements:** Estimate how much data will be stored and processed.
  * Example: "If each request generates 1 KB of data, we need to store approximately 10 GB of data daily."
* **Bandwidth Requirements:** Calculate the bandwidth needed to handle data transfer.
  * Example: "With each request/response being 1 KB, we need a bandwidth of around 10 GB per day."
* **Tips:**
  * **Be Realistic:** Use realistic assumptions and data for calculations.
  * **Document Assumptions:** Clearly state any assumptions you make during calculations.
  * **Prepare for Questions:** Be ready to explain and justify your calculations.

***

**Step 7: Security Considerations**

* **Data Protection:** Talk about securing data in transit and at rest.
  * Example: "We'll use SSL/TLS for data in transit and AES encryption for data at rest."
* **Access Controls:** Describe how you'll manage user permissions and roles.
  * Example: "We'll implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles."
* **Tips:**
  * **Think Like an Attacker:** Identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.
  * **Use Encryption:** Always encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.
  * **Limit Access:** Apply the principle of least privilege to minimize risks.

***

**Step 8: Monitoring and Maintenance**

* **Monitoring Tools:** Explain how you’ll monitor the system's health and performance.
  * Example: "We'll use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring metrics and setting up alerts."
* **Maintenance Plan:** Discuss how you’ll handle updates and maintenance without downtime.
  * Example: "We'll use blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates."
* **Tips:**
  * **Automate Monitoring:** Use automated tools to track system performance and detect issues.
  * **Proactive Maintenance:** Plan regular maintenance to prevent issues before they occur.
  * **Stay Informed:** Keep up with the latest best practices and tools for monitoring and maintenance.

***

**Step 9: Trade-offs and Considerations**

* **Discuss Alternatives:** Mention any alternative solutions and why you chose your approach.
  * Example: "We considered using a monolithic architecture but opted for microservices for better scalability."
* **Acknowledge Trade-offs:** Be honest about the trade-offs of your design.
  * Example: "While microservices offer scalability, they also introduce complexity in terms of communication and monitoring."
* **Tips:**
  * **Be Honest:** Clearly explain the trade-offs and why you made certain decisions.
  * **Balance Needs:** Consider all aspects, including performance, cost, and complexity.
  * **Be Open:** Show that you are open to feedback and willing to adjust your design if needed.
