# 2-3 Tree

2-3 tree is a way to generalize BSTs to provide the flexibility that we need to guarantee fast performance. In 2-node, we have one link for the keys that are less than the key in the node, and one link for the keys that are greater. In a 3-node, we need three links, one for less, one for between and one for greater.

Each transformation maintains the symmetric order and perfect balance
